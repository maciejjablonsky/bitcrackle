# 🎛️ bitcrackle

**bitcrackle** is a hobbyist, educational MIDI 1.0 engine built with the Windows API and powered by compile-time C++. It connects to an 8-bit-style synthesizer and explores the beauty of inaccurate, quantized, bit-limited sound.

> "When you hear the crackle, you're hearing the math."

## ✨ Features

- ⏱️ **Compile-time-safe arithmetic** for 8/16/32-bit operations  
- 🎹 **MIDI 1.0 input/output** via Win32 API  
- 🎛️ Custom **bit-accurate audio translation layer**  
- 🧪 Designed for **learning**, **experimentation**, and **bit-level sound design**  
- 🔌 Synth connector for **external 8-bit-style hardware** or emulated devices  
- ⚙️ Built with modern C++ (constexpr, templates, zero-allocation where possible)

## 🔧 Goals

- Understand MIDI 1.0 deeply by implementing from scratch
- Use C++ compile-time techniques to eliminate bugs and enforce correctness
- Hear the results of bit errors, overflows, and quantization in real sound
- Have fun building a weird little synth engine
